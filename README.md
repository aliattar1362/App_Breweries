# Breweries App

## Overview

This project is built with React and TypeScript, focusing on honing skills in fetching, displaying, and searching data from designated API endpoints.

## Custom Hooks

- **useFetch**: This hook retrieves an array containing brewery company objects, each accompanied by its respective properties. This data is employed to render the complete list of brewery companies on the UI Company page.

## Routes

The most recent version of React Router is utilized for navigation, comprising two primary pages, namely Home and Companies, along with one associated sub-page called CompanyDetail.

## Home Page

- This serves as the default landing page of the application.
- The user interface features a search bar allowing users to search for brewery companies.

## Company Page

- This page displays the names of all brewery companies collectively.
- Users can click on the company names to navigate to the company detail page for further information.

## Company Details Page

- This page can be reached by selecting the "more..." option for searched companies on the home page or by navigating through the companies link within the company page.
- It offers supplementary details for each company, including its address, postal code, telephone number, and a direct link to its website, if available.

## Styling

Material UI components are utilized alongside custom CSS styling to design and refine the appearance of the React components across the application.
